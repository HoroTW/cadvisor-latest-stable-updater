# cAdvisor latest/stable updater

![Screenshot](Screenshot.png)

This script will check if there is a new version of cAdvisor available and update the `.env` file with the new image tag.

## The issue
**This shouldn't need to exist**, üòÖ 
but because the latest tag of the cAdvisor project is not updated on gcr.io... (see https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/3066)

Which means that all `docker-compose` files that use the latest tag, get an outdated version from late 2020... 

So if you thought something like:
> "I should use the latest tag so I get updates and don't have to worry about running an old version - with potential security issues..." 

You thought wrong... So did I üòÖ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - down the drain with my automated pre-update snapshot + Watchtower update system ü§£.

So all that leads to the need for a manual update every time a new version of cAdvisor is released ... and all the implications that come with it, like even noticing that a new version is available...

## Solution (Workaround)
I wrote a small script that cross-references the latest (stable) release of cAdvisor on github (https://github.com/google/cadvisor) with the corresponding image on gcr.io and updates if necessary.

The image (with tag) is stored in a `.env` file and is used in the `docker-compose` file.
So the script basically just updates the `.env` file and then runs the normal `docker-compose up -d` command.

Most of the code is just sanity checks to ensure that nothing unexpected has changed (and if it has, it does nothing and exits with an error message).

## Installation
You can just clone this repo into the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is and run the script from there, maybe you need to set the executable flag first.

In your `docker-compose.yml` file you need to change the image variable to this:
```yaml
image: ${CADVISOR_LATEST_IMAGE}
```

This variable is provided by the `.env` file.

## Usage
```bash
./updater.sh [-y] # -y: update without confirmation
```

## Requirements
The updater needs root or will ask for sudo permissions because in my case the .env is not writable by a normal user.

Of course you can change that if you don't like this behavior.

Happy updating üòÅ
