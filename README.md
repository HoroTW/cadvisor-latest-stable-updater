# cadvisor-latest-stable-updater
This should not need to exist... But because the latest tag of the cadvisor project is not updated on gcr.io -> which leads to the need for manual updates ... I wrote a small script that crossreferences the latest (stable) release of cadvisor on github with the image in gcr and updates it.
